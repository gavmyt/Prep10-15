<p>
The most difficult concept I feel I have an understanding of us is the most basic, simple, barebones version of the core d3 algorithm.
My most basic understanding of this is using the d3 to create elements within the html file and insert data, such as:
</p>
<ol>
<li> select </li>
<li> append </li>
<li> selectAll </li>
<li> data </li>
<li> enter </li>
<li> append </li>
<li> text </li>
</ol>
<p> .select is where you select the specific div you are referencing by getting it's selector </p>
<p> .append is where you are creating the element to put within the div </p>
<p> .selectAll is selecting the element(s) you are pulling out of the data set </p>
<p> .data is selecting the data set you are pulling from </p>
<p> .enter is selecting where you are entering but it cannot make the connection yet
<p> .append is creating the element to put within the div </p>
<p> .text is what else you are attaching inside the div alongside the data </p>
